# Halo Streamers
This is a little sinatra site made for my good friend [Andrew "aWildeOne" Wilde](http://twitch.tv/awildeone) to use on Twitch.tv this is meant as a custom handler for [NightBot](http://www.nightbot.tv/)

It currently displays the live runners from [HaloRuns.com](http://haloruns.com/runners)'s streamer page and outputs a nice little formatted text listing online streamers.



## I want to use this myself!
It's pretty easy. It's a simple sinatra application. Run the bundle for the gems and the only configuration you'll need is a Twitch TV API Client Key. With a little bit of Ruby knowledge, you can also configure it to add additional streams to the Halo Streamer list, not use the halo streamer list at all.

## I'm a Halo Runner and I want this on my stream!
You're also in luck, but not right now. I'm planning on hosting this for public, that should be coming soonâ„¢.

## I want something similar for my own list of streams...
...but I don't have the resources to set it up myself

I have no plans for this, but if there is interest, hit me up on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/_ubercow) and I might be able to set something up.

## Is it cool
yes

## Your program sucks and I can make it better
Please do! If there is something I can do better, I'll happily accept pull requests.

## You smell and I want to steal this for my own site
As long as you follow the terms indicated in the LICENSE file, go right ahead.
